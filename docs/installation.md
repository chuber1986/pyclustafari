# Installation

## Stable release

This will only work if the project was uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI).

To install SlurmLib, run this command in your
terminal:

```console
$ pip install slurmlib
```

This is the preferred method to install SlurmLib, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.

## From source

The source for SlurmLib can be downloaded from
the [Gitlab repo][].

Clone the repository:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/chuber1986/slurmlib
```

It is highly recommended to use the SSH link (starting with 'git:') instead of the HTTPS link (staring with 'https:').

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

```console
$ pip install .
```
